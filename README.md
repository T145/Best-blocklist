# Best Blocklist
Looking for a nice and complete blocklist for torrent software can be a pain, especially if you’re not sure which one to pick. In fact, there are a ton of lists all for different purposes, and none seem to provide complete bad-peer protection.

Here is my black list! It only bans bad peer and some copyright IPs. Other blacklists ban many good IPs for the seedbox.
